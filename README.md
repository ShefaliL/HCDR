# Home Credit Default Risk

In todayâ€™s world, many people struggle to get loans due to insufficient credit histories or even non-existing credit records, which often tend to untrustworthy lenders who exploit them.
Home Credit acts towards expanding the financial inclusion for the unbanked by providing a secure borrowingexperience.
Home credit utilizes several alternative data and methods to predict their repaymentabilities. 
To ensure that this underserved demographic has a favorable loan experience, we will beusing machine learning and statistical methods to determine these predictions. 
This ensures that the lients who are capable of repayment will be granted a loan and are not rejected by any means.
Also,they will be given a loan maturity plan and a repayment calendar that will accredit our clients to bemore successful. 
The goal is bifurcated in phases.
This phases work on the Home Credit Default Risk (HCDR) data and perform some cleaning and preprocessing techniques and modeling techniques with pipelining to predict whether a person receives a loan or not. 
After merging all subordinate files, cleaning the data, and performing some exploratory data analysis.
Applying some preprocessing steps which also include dividing the data into numerical and categorical values. 
The next step involved creating new features from the existing features that could add on as a good predictor in the existing dataset. 
The project included 2 phases where, the first phase included training the model without feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning,
the second phase included creation of 11 new features from the existing important features and 
creating a modeling pipeline where we determine the best hyperparameters (hyperparameter tuning) for the models to select the best model. 
The testing data was then parsed through the best model to get the test results. 
The best model for the second phase was of the Random Forest Classifier with a training accuracy of 92.4% and a test roc score of 0.72814.

# FUTURE SCOPE
After the aforementioned step, I also plan to apply Deep Learning techniques like developing Artificial Neural Networks for better prediction results.
